## Appendix: Metrics Definitions

### Core Metrics
- **Coding Time**: Average daily time spent coding per developer
- **PR Size**: Average number of lines changed per PR
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from first commit to production
- **Review Time**: Average PR review completion time

### Derived Metrics
- **PR Throughput**: Number of PRs merged over time
- **Review Thoroughness**: Comments per 100 lines of code
- **Time to First Review**: Average time between PR creation and first review
- **PR Quality Score**: Composite score based on size, reviews, tests, and documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Use React for all component development
- Maintain consistent styling with the existing design system
- Ensure all metrics have clear tooltips explaining their meaning
- Include toggles to hide/show metrics based on team preferences
