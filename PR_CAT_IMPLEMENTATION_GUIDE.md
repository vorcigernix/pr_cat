### Architecture Improvements

#### Centralized Repository Access

To ensure consistent access patterns and prevent code duplication, the repository access logic has been centralized:

1. **Repository Service**
   - Created a centralized `RepositoryService` class with static methods
   - Implements organization-based access control in one place
   - Provides consistent repository access across the application
   - Separates business logic from data access

2. **Organization-Based Access Control**
   - Access is based on GitHub organizational boundaries
   - Users who have added PR Cat to their GitHub organizations can access those repositories
   - Repositories are always presented in their organizational context
   - User interfaces are built around organization selection first, then repositories

3. **Service Integration Plan**
   - Update all pages to use the RepositoryService instead of direct database queries
   - Remove duplicate implementation of repository queries
   - Standardize the organization-based access control across the application
   - Provide consistent user experience between settings and webhook configuration

4. **Architectural Benefits**
   - Single source of truth for repository access logic
   - Consistent error handling and logging
   - Easier to maintain and extend
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Respect for GitHub's organizational boundaries

The repository service implements a layer of abstraction between the raw database queries and the application's business logic, making it easier to:
- Change the underlying database without affecting the rest of the application
- Implement complex access control rules in one place
- Test repository access logic in isolation
- Add caching or other optimizations at the service level

This architectural improvement addresses issues with duplicate code and inconsistent access patterns that were causing problems in the webhook configuration page.

- **Repositories**: GitHub repositories with metadata
- **PullRequests**: PR data with metadata and categorization
- **Categories**: Investment area definitions and rules
- **Reviews**: PR review data and metrics
- **Settings**: User and organization settings
- **Recommendations**: Generated improvement recommendations

### Direct SQL Implementation

For optimal Turso database usage:

1. Use direct SQL queries instead of ORMs
2. Implement prepared statements for security
3. Use Turso's vector capabilities for semantic search
4. Create optimized indexes for common query patterns
5. Use database transactions for data consistency

### GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration requires:

1. OAuth authentication for user access
2. Organization and repository selection
3. Webhook configuration for real-time updates
4. API access for historical data collection
5. Permission scopes:
   - `repo` - For repository access
   - `read:org` - For organization data
   - `user:email` - For user identification

### AI Categorization Process

The AI categorization should:

1. Extract relevant text from PR (title, description, files changed)
2. Generate a structured prompt with context
3. Call AI service for categorization
4. Parse and validate response
5. Store categorization with confidence score
6. Allow manual overrides

### Vercel Resource Configuration

Optimize Vercel resources by:

1. Using Edge functions for lightweight operations
2. Implementing serverless functions for heavier processing
3. Setting up Cron jobs for periodic tasks
4. Using KV store for caching and job state

1. Complete database setup with direct SQL to Turso
2. Finish GitHub integration
3. Implement data collection and storage
4. Build AI processing pipeline
5. Connect UI to real data sources
6. Implement recommendations engine
